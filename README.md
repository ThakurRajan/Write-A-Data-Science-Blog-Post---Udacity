    Question 1 :- What's the ratio of total wages/ total potential for clubs. Which clubs are the most economical ï¼Ÿ
    Question 2 :- How is nation team player total market value distributed? Probably show a distribution plot in a world map?
    Question 3 :- How is a player's skilsl set influence his potential/wage? Can we predict a player's potential based on his skills' set?
